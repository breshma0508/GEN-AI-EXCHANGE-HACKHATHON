### üáÆüá≥ BHARAT KALASANS ‚Äî A GENAI-POWERED PLATFORM FOR LOCAL ARTISANS

> **TAGLINE**: Empowering India's artisans with AI-driven storytelling, visibility, and growth.

---

## üõë PROBLEM STATEMENT

Many small-scale industries and local artisans in India face major challenges in showcasing their products to customers.

Even though they have excellent manufacturing skills and unique crafts, their work often remains hidden from mainstream markets.

They depend heavily on middlemen, who take a large share of the profit, leaving artisans with very little income.

As a result, artisans are unable to grow their businesses, while large-scale industries dominate with better marketing and visibility.

There is no single platform where artisans can present their products, stories, and processes directly to customers in an engaging way.

This disconnect not only reduces their earnings but also threatens the survival of India‚Äôs rich traditional heritage and small-scale industries.

## üí° PROPOSED SOLUTION

We propose **BHARAT KALASANS**, a GenAI-driven digital platform that empowers artisans to:

- ‚úÖ Create profiles showcasing their products, photos, and videos of their manufacturing process.
- ü§ñ Use Generative AI to automatically generate product descriptions, multilingual bios, and storytelling content.
- üó∫Ô∏è Display artisan locations on an **interactive India map**, making discovery easy for customers.
- üì± Promote themselves through **integrated social media links** (YouTube, Instagram) and **existing e-commerce stores** (Amazon, Flipkart, Etsy).
- üèõÔ∏è Access simplified information about **government schemes** such as ODOP, PM Vishwakarma, KVIC, and MSME support.

This solution removes dependence on middlemen, gives artisans direct access to customers, increases their income, and helps preserve India‚Äôs cultural heritage while making it digitally visible to the world.
